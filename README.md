## 🏆 TechniCodeCamp Hackathon Winner - 1st Place

Built in just 24 hours at TechniCodeCamp Hackathon, IntervYou is an AI-powered interview preparation platform that helps job seekers practice interviews, get instant feedback, and improve their skills through personalized flashcards and learning roadmaps.
